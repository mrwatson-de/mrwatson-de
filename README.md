### Well found! üòéüëç

Are you a [FileMaker](https://www.claris.com/filemaker/) developer wanting more from life - such as the best FileMaker tools that money can't buy (because they are already **FREE!**) - then you've come to the right place!

You can find my most popular tools pinned below, or if you're looking for fmIDE you'll find it in the [fmIDE/fmIDE repository](https://github.com/fmIDE/fmIDE/wiki). Alternatively you can **[find all my tools HERE](https://github.com/mrwatson-de?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers)**.

If you are new to GitHub, just getting oriented or have some other question you might want to read the [FAQ](faq.md)

Happy FileMaking!
