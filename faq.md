# Frequently Asked Questions

Newcomers to GitHub may feel a little confused or overwehlmed by the release, download and other forking possibilities available, so here is a little help

## First up: what's a repository?

A repository is basically just a place where code is stored - in this case on GitHub. The fmWorkMate repository, for example, is here: https://github.com/mrwatson-de/fmworkmate

The complicated bit, is that there are several ways to 'get' the code, depending on exactly what you want to get - or to give!

## How do I best download MrWatson’s tools from GitHub?

First of all browse to the tool’s repository.

- If you are still looking for the repositories, you'll find what you are looking for in the [repository list](https://github.com/mrwatson-de?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers)

If you are wanting to just **download and use a tool**

- Download the **latest Release**:
  - `Releases > Latest Release > Download zip`
- The main benefit of the release-zip is that it contains the (pretty) mac file icons


If the repository has no releases or if you want to *use* the very latest development version of the tool
- Download the latest zip-file on the green Code button
  - `Code > Download ZIP`


On the other hand, if you want to join in helping develop the code...

## Using Git / GitHub Desktop to contribute...

> Need to clear up the best way of doing this, since FileMaker files and GitHub don't work great together.

Basically:

- Create yourself a GitHub account, if you don't yet have one
- Star &/ Watch your favourite repositories
- Follow mrwatson-de
- Then...

**If you want to experiment** with the code, or test out using GitHub

- Fork the repo to your own GitHub account (for yourself)
- Clone your repo to your computer
- Play around

**If you have FileMaker code to contribute**...
- Let me know what you have added / changed
- We'll review the changes and work out the best way to integrate them into the master database.

**If you have documentation to contribute**, you can use Git / Github to clone a repository to your local machine

## Cloning a repository to your computer

Do this if you want to contribute changes back to the project.

- Clone the repository to your computer
  - I use
    - the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app in order to get a pleasant GUI and make it easier 
    - a folder in my documents folder, where I put all my GitHub projects `~/Documents/Git/<repositoryname>`
  - If you are using the git command line, good luck!


Since FileMaker files change every time you open them:
  - I tend to copy the FileMaker file(s) to another directory, and
  - only copy them back to the repo folder if I have really changed them and want to synchronise the changes back to GitHub


- make changes
- copy the FileMaker files back to the repo folder
- make a Pull Request

We'll see how it goes from there! 😉
